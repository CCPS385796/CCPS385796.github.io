 <h1>About Me>
   <p>In my personal life I am working on towards helping others when they are at they're at their lowest or need help such as being a therapist. Being a therapist was always the main goal for me as I would always help my friends when they needed help mentally and it felt nice to help my friends or others and how they could trust me with their problems. Working towards this goal I'm currently trying to study phycology to try and see on the reasons on how and why people think the way they think. Also I'm looking and studying certain collages that would help me win my goal on being a therapist. Values I consider most necessary for my success is I am trying to keep my study and social skills balanced so it could help me get into the collage I am applying to later on, also another value I consider valuable is learning on how to earn people's trust, by doing that people could see that I am trust worthy enough to open up to. Some character traits and achievements I would be want to be known for is, I would want people to see me as a person that is easy to open up to, I would want others to trust me. I would also want people to see me as a bright and kind person that would help nd give the best advice to help them.</p>
